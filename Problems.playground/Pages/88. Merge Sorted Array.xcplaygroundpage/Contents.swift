/*
 You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

 Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

 The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.


 Example 1:
     Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
     Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
     Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].

 Example 2:
     Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
     Output: [1]
     Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
     The result of the merge is [1].

 Example 3:
     Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
     Output: [1]
     Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
     The result of the merge is [1].
     Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
